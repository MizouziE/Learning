### To-Do ->  [NodeJS & MongoDB](https://github.com/MizouziE/Learning/tree/master/NodeJS-MongoDB)
- [x] When I tried to do it I was working from a Raspberry Pi running a funky ARM64 OS and mongosh was super unusable :space_invader:
- [x] UPDATE: Currently working on getting docker container working for this directory alone
- [x] It's coming along slowly and so far this subfolder contains a working Dockerfile and .yml
- [x] However, subsequent fresh installation of working-dir and MongoDB driver (via npm install) is still required...
- [x] UPDATE: ...on the update. I'm gonna give up with the dev container idea cos it just doesn't work on a raspberry pi running even the arm64 OS. I'll be back with a proper computer next week so I'll just run MongoDB on the big machine
